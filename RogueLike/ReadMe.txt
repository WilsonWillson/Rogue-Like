Known Issues:
The A.I. is dumb and doesnt always prioritize attacking over moving. If you can get an enemy pursuing you in a hallway you might have to move around a corner for him to decide to attack
1 warning.

Things You Might Miss:
Space bar currently auto equips the item if there the player doesn't have any items in that slot. For the enemy there is a weight system to determine which item to proritize. This is special for each creature and is data-driven.

Controls:

s- play demo sound
Space is rest or picks up an item you are on

Data driven systems do make adding things so much eaiser. I love them. Even adding whole new systems with new xml files is pretty easy with the features already built in.
I would enjoy if we went over the negatives of data driven programming, cause right now I only see the positives. Also a difficulty I discovered on this assignment, saving cleaning up code till the end is really hard and doesnt always turn out the best. I should clean as I complete little objectives in the assignment.

It was nice to start over with an almost blank game and try and arcitecture code and figure out where to put classes to future build
the process. It's like a puzzle, both with the logic of how classes should interact with each other and where the pieces of this puzzle
should go. I really enjoyed doing it, since most of the gameplay is very easy SD1-2 tasks, and  found that to be the most challenging
piece of this assignment. It will be intresting to see what problems we encounter with our design, and wehter they will be easier or difficult
because of our choices
